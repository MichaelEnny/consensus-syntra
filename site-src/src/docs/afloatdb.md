# AfloatDB - Distributed Key-Value Store on top of ConsensusSyntra

[AfloatDB](https://github.com/ConsensusSyntra/AfloatDB) is a very simple distributed key-value store
built on top of [ConsensusSyntra](https://github.com/ConsensusSyntra/ConsensusSyntra). It demonstrates how ConsensusSyntra's abstractions are implemented using Protocol Buffers and gRPC.
